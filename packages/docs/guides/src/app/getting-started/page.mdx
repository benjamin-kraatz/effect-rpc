# Getting Started: First steps in Effect RPC

Alright, it's time to get the feet wet and dive into the world of Effect RPC. We're going to use a default template app with both [Next.js](#next-js) and [TanStack Start](#tanstack-start) and extend them with a type-safe, error-handled, modular, Effect-ive client-server communication.
The apps we'öö build are pretty simple, but they will give you a solid foundation to build upon.

## Prerequisites

- **Knowledge of Full-Stack Development**: Effect RPC is designed for full-stack frameworks, such as Next.js. If you don't know what that is, you're probably not at the right place.
- **Familiarity with Effect**: Effect RPC is built on top of the Effect library, so you should have a basic understanding of how Effect works. If you don't know what Effect is, check out the awesome [Effect website](https://effect.website/). You _can_ use Effect RPC without prior knowledge and adopt it incrementally, but this guide is _not an Effect tuttorial_. Their docs are awesome, head over to [Effect Docs](https://effect.website/docs) to get started.
- **@effect/rpc**: (optional) If you bring some @effect/rpc experience, it will help you a bit more through this guide, but it's not crucial. At the end, it is just Effect, and the rest is as easy to learn as Effect RPC.

<AlertBlock type="warning" title="Note">
We're currently finding out the best name for the package to reduce the confusion with `@effect/rpc`. Effect RPC, this library, and `@effect/rpc`, the package from the Effect authors, are not the same. Effect RPC builds on top of `@effect/rpc`. We might have found a better name in the future.

Last but not least, grab yourself a cup of coffee or tea, sit back, and let's get started!

## Next.js

Scaffold a new Next.js app with the following command:

<CodeBlock language="bash">{`pnpm create next-app@latest --typescript --eslint --tailwind --app
`}</CodeBlock>

Install the Effect RPC package:


<CodeBlock language="bash">{`pnpm add effect-rpc
`}</CodeBlock>

We also need some `effect` packages to get started:

<CodeBlock language="bash">{`pnpm add effect @effect/platform @effect/rpc
`}</CodeBlock>

> We recommend checking the `packages/effect-rpc/package.json` to see the versions that Effect RPC uses. They should match as best as possible to avoid conflicts.
