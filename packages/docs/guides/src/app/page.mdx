# Welcome to Effect RPC

Effect RPC is a modern library designed to simplify and streamline the process of building robust client-server applications. This guide will introduce you to the core concepts and benefits of Effect RPC, helping you quickly become productive and confident in building scalable, type-safe applications.

## Why Effect RPC?

Developing client-server applications often involves repetitive boilerplate, manual API definitions, and constant synchronization between frontend and backend. Managing serialization, deserialization, and ensuring type safety across the stack can be tedious and error-prone.

Effect RPC addresses these challenges by allowing you to define your API as a TypeScript interface. The library then generates all the necessary code to connect your client and server, eliminating boilerplate and reducing the risk of inconsistencies. This approach lets you focus on building features, not plumbing.

## Key Benefits

Effect RPC offers several advantages:

*   **End-to-end type safety:** Ensure your client and server remain in sync, catching errors at compile time rather than in production.
*   **Zero-overhead architecture:** Build fast, scalable applications without performance bottlenecks.
*   **Protocol agnostic:** Use HTTP, WebSockets, WebRTC, or any transport layer that fits your needs.
*   **Isomorphic code:** Share code between client and server, reducing duplication and maintenance overhead.
*   **Extensibility:** Customize Effect RPC with your own middleware, transports, or integrations to fit your specific requirements.

## Who Should Use Effect RPC?

Effect RPC is ideal for developers who want to build modern, scalable, and type-safe web applications, including:

*   **Full-stack developers:** Seamlessly build and maintain unified codebases across client and server.
*   **Frontend developers:** Consume APIs easily without worrying about low-level implementation details.
*   **Backend developers:** Create flexible, maintainable APIs with strong type guarantees and high performance.

<AlertBlock type="error" title="Note">
Effect RPC is designed to work with applications that already use the Effect library. If you don't use Effect at all, Effect RPC may not be the best fit for your project.  
However, if you are already leveraging Effect's powerful features, Effect RPC will enhance your development experience significantly.
You _can_ use Effect RPC without already using Effect in your project, and slowly migrate to use Effect. The power of Effect is that you can adopt it incrementally, allowing you to start with Effect RPC and gradually incorporate more of the Effect ecosystem as your project evolves.
