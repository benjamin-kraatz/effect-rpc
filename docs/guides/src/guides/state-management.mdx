# State Management: Taming the State Monster

Welcome back, my friend! In this section, we're going to talk about state management. State management is one of the most challenging parts of building a web application. It's like trying to tame a wild beast. But don't worry, with RPC-Less and Zustand, we can tame the state monster together.

## What is State?

Before we dive into state management, let's talk about what state actually is. State is just a fancy word for data that changes over time. It's the data that your application needs to keep track of, like the items in a shopping cart, the text in a search box, or the user that's currently logged in.

### Why is it so hard?

State management is hard because state is constantly changing. And when state changes, you need to make sure that your UI is updated to reflect those changes. This can be a tricky business, especially in large and complex applications.

This is where state management libraries come in. They provide a structured way to manage your state, which makes it easier to reason about your application and prevent bugs.

## Zustand: The State Management Superhero

There are a lot of state management libraries out there, but our favorite is [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand). Zustand is a small, fast, and scalable state management library that's a perfect match for RPC-Less. It's simple, it's intuitive, and it's a joy to use.

### Creating a store

With Zustand, you create a store to hold your state. A store is just a plain old JavaScript object that contains your state and any actions that can modify that state.

Let's create a store for our todo application. Create a new file called `src/store.ts` and add the following code:

```ts
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { client } from './client'
import { api } from './api'

type Todo = api['getTodo']['output']

interface Store {
  todos: Todo[]
  addTodo: (todo: Todo) => void
  fetchTodos: () => Promise<void>
}

export const useStore = create<Store>((set) => ({
  todos: [],
  addTodo: (todo) => set((state) => ({ todos: [...state.todos, todo] })),
  fetchTodos: async () => {
    const todos = await client.getTodos()
    set({ todos })
  },
}))
```

In this example, we're creating a store with an initial state that contains an empty array of todos. We're also defining two actions: `addTodo` and `fetchTodos`. The `addTodo` action adds a new todo to the store, and the `fetchTodos` action fetches the todos from the server and updates the store.

### Using the store

To use the store in your components, you use the `useStore` hook.

```tsx
import { useStore } from '../store'

function MyComponent() {
  const todos = useStore((state) => state.todos)
  const addTodo = useStore((state) => state.addTodo)
  const fetchTodos = useStore((state) => state.fetchTodos)

  React.useEffect(() => {
    fetchTodos()
  }, [fetchTodos])

  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {todos.map((todo) => (
          <li key={todo.id}>{todo.title}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <button
        onClick={() =>
          addTodo({ id: 1, title: 'New Todo', completed: false })
        }
      >
        Add Todo
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

In this example, we're using the `useStore` hook to get the `todos`, `addTodo`, and `fetchTodos` from the store. We're then displaying the todos in a list and providing a button to add a new todo.

## The End of the Road (For State Management)

And that's it for state management! You've learned about what state is, why it's so hard to manage, and how to use Zustand to tame the state monster. You're now a state management expert, ready to build any application you can imagine.

In the next section, we'll talk about testing. So, take a break, grab a snack, and I'll see you in the next section.
